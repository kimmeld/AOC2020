# 2020 Day 7

This solution requires some setup in the UniVerse environment before it can be run.

## Setup

First, create a file to hold the list of rules:

```
CREATE.FILE AOC.2020.07.BAGS 30
```

Next, create the dictionary entries for the file.  These are required this time because we will create indexes on this file.

```

                                                                                          INS.BAG
                                                                                          S
CONTAINS.COLOU    D    3                                     Contains Colour    20L       M CONTA
R                                                                                         INS.BAG
                                                                                          S
CONTAINED.BY.C    D    4                                     Contained By Co    20L       M

                            CONTAINS.COLO
                            UR

6 records listed.
```

Fields 2 and 3 are a multivalue association, `CONTAINS.BAGS`, which allows the query language to understand how they are related.  Field 4 is multivalued, but not associated with the other fields.


Finally, create some indexes on this file in order to speed up processing:

```
CREATE.INDEX AOC.2020.07.BAGS BAG.COLOUR CONTAINS.COLOUR CONTAINED.BY.COLOURS
BUILD.INDEX AOC.2020.07.BAGS ALL
```

## Running it

Load the records into the data file using `RUN BP AOC.2020.07.LOAD`.  This creates the records describing the bag containment rules and builds the back references (field 4 `CONTAINED.BY.COLOURS`).

Now execute either `RUN BP AOC.2020.07.PART1` or `RUN BP AOC.2020.07.PART2`

## Notes

`AOC.2020.07.PART1` is a straight-forward procedural implementation of the problem.

`AOC.2020.07.PART2` uses a recursive subroutine (`AOC.2020.07.PART2.SUM.BAGS`) in order to sum up the number of bags in a straight-forward manner.  The `COMMON` declaration is used to share the file variable between all of the code involved instead of opening the file repeatedly.
