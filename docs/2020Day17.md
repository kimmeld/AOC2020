# 2020 Day 17

Once again, this requires a UniVerse hashed file to store its intermediate data.  In this case, the hashed file uses record IDs which are composed of multiple parts.  In SQL, this would be a primary key made up of multiple fields, but in UniVerse we construct these by hand.

## Setup

Create the file as a Type 30 like usual:
```
CREATE.FILE AOC.2020.17.CUBES 30
```
 
Create dictionary entries in the file which look like this:
```
DICT AOC.2020.17.CUBES    05:21:12pm  17 Dec 2020  Page    1

                            ,4)
Y                 I         FIELD(@ID,'*'    MD0             Y                  10R       S
                            ,3)
X                 I         FIELD(@ID,'*'    MD0             X                  10R       S
                            ,2)
TURN              I         FIELD(@ID,'*'    MD0             Turn               10R       S
                            ,1)
W                 I         FIELD(@ID,'*'    MD0             W                  10R       S
                            ,5)
@                 PH        ID.SUP TURN X
                            Y Z W
                            CUBE.STAT

8 records listed.
```

In this case, the `CUBE.STAT` and `TURN` fields are *required* because the final answer is actually determined using the query processor, not by counting records in code.
