# 2020 Day 15

The only interesting thing here is a data file to hold the data as the program works through the problem.

## Setup

The file is a dynamic file created as follows:
```
CREATE.FILE AOC.2020.15.NUMBERS 30
```

The dictionary is optional, but if you wish to inspect the data after a run it may be useful.  The dictionary I used looks like this:

```
DICT AOC.2020.15.NUMBERS    11:48:04am  16 Dec 2020  Page    1

                  Type &
Field.........    Field.    Field........    Conversion..    Column.........    Output    Depth &
Name..........    Number    Definition...    Code........    Heading........    Format    Assoc..

@ID               D    0                                     AOC.2020.15.NUM    10L       S
                                                             BERS
SPOKEN            D    1                     MD0             Spoken Times       10R       M

2 records listed.
```

`@ID` is the number, `SPOKEN` is a list of the two most recent times the number has been spoken.  The program only keeps the two most recent values in order to keep the amount of data written down to a reasonable level.  That said, this file still ends up with over 3.6M records in it based on my input data.
