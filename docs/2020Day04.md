# 2020 Day 4
I've written two solutions to 2020 Day 4.  The first solution is a straight-forward UniVerse BASIC program which comes up with the correct answers.  The second solution is how this type of thing may be developed in a real-world UniVerse application, though like any other development task there are many ways to do this.

## Setup
First, create a file to hold the passport data:
```
CREATE.FILE AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS 30
```
This creates a dynamic (Type 30) file which will hold our incoming passport data.  It also creates a data dictionary for the file with only the default @ID record.

Next, create the DICT entries for the data fields in the file:
```
AE DICT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS BYR IYR EYR HGT HCL ECL PID CID
```

The individual DICT entries look like this (field numbers included for clarity):
```
001: D
002: 1
003:
004: Birth Year
005: 10R
006: S
```

This defines a Data element (field 1 = D), in field 1 of the records (field 2 = 1), no conversions (field 3) are applied, the heading (field 4), the width and justification (field 5), and whether it is Single-valued or Multi-valued (field 6).

There are two more fields to define, but these are slightly different.  These fields are I-Decriptors, which is a field that doesn't refer to a piece of data but instead executes a calculation in order to determine the field's value.  For this exercise, the I-Descriptors will be used to indicate whether each passport record is valid based on the rules defined in Part 1 and Part 2.

Here is what the Part 1 I-Descriptor looks like:
```
001: I
002: SUBR('AOC.2020.04.ALT.PART1',@RECORD)
003: MD0
004: Part 1 Valid
005: 10R
006: S
```

The key differences between this and the D-descriptors defined above are:
* Field 1 is 'I', which denotes an I-Descriptor
* Field 2 is code which calculates the value.  In this case, the SUBR function is used to execute the Part 1 validation subroutine.
* Field 3 contains a conversion code.  This is not specific to I-Descriptors, but because this is a numeric field so we've applied a masked-decimal conversion with 0 decimal places.

Once your dictionary is built, it should look like this:
```

                            1',@RECORD)
PART2.VALID       I         SUBR('AOC.202    MD0             Part 2 Valid       10R       S
                            0.04.ALT.PART
                            2',@RECORD)

11 records listed.
```

## Running the Programs
At this point, you can execute `RUN BP AOC.2020.04.ALT.LOAD` to load the data into this table and use the query commands to explore the data.

When the PART1.VALID and PART2.VALID fields are used, UniVerse will execute the I-Descriptor code and call the subroutines which determine whether the record is valid.

My input data, for example, returns the following for a few sample queries:
```
>COUNT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS

286 records counted.
>COUNT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS WITH PART1.VALID = 1

242 records counted.
>COUNT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS WITH PART2.VALID = 1

186 records counted.
>COUNT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS WITH PART1.VALID = 0 AND PART2.VALID = 1

0 records counted.
>COUNT AOC.2020.04.PASSPORTS WITH PART1.VALID = 1 AND PART2.VALID = 0

56 records counted.
