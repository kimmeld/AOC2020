This solution uses a UniVerse hash file to store the data in "memory".

## Setup

First, create a file to hold the "memory":

```
CREATE.FILE AOC.2020.14.MEMORY 30
```

Next, modify the dictionary as follows:

```
DICT AOC.2020.14.MEMORY    08:08:17pm  14 Dec 2020  Page    1

                  Type &
Field.........    Field.    Field........    Conversion..    Column.........    Output    Depth &
Name..........    Number    Definition...    Code........    Heading........    Format    Assoc..

@ID               D    0                                     AOC.2020.14.MEM    36L       S
                                                             ORY
VALUE             D    1                     MD0             Value              30R       S

2 records listed.
```

The key changes are to create the `VALUE` entry and to modify the `@ID` entry to use a format code of 36L.

None of this is actually required by the program, but it gives you the ability to use the query language to inspect the contents of the "memory."

## Running it

This program is standalone, it doesn't require you to run multiple programs in some sequence.  The above setup is only required to give the program a work area.
